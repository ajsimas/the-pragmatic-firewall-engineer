# The Pragmatic Firewall Engineer

## Introduction

Firewall policy is more than just a list of access rules. It is a strategic,
living document that defines the trust relationships within a network. Despite
its importance, firewall policy is often created hastily and without a clear
methodology or long-term plan. This guide is written for professional firewall
administrators who want to design policy that is not only secure and efficient,
but also scalable, maintainable, and audit-friendly. Rather than focusing on
technical steps or product-specific features, this guide emphasizes the “why”
behind policy decisions. This guide presents a vendor-neutral framework, that
includes proven best practices, and practical wisdom. Whether you're building
from scratch or cleaning up years of legacy rules, this guide will help you
approach firewall policy with intention and clarity.
