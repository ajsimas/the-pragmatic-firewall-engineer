# Core design principles

Designing effective firewall policy requires consistent methodology and a
structured approach that can be repeated, defended, and maintained over time.
The principles in this section are not specific to any vendor or platform.
Instead, they reflect a strategic mindset that helps firewall administrators
create rulesets that are secure, scalable, and operationally sustainable.
Whether you're starting from scratch or refining an existing deployment, these
principles serve as a foundation for making informed, intentional policy
decisions.

## Understand your network

Before writing a single firewall rule, you must have a clear understanding of
the network you're defending. This includes knowing what systems exist, how they
communicate, which of those communications are critical to operations. and where
your crown jewels are.

1. Identify the systems and services that exist on your network.
2. Identify various trust zones that make up your network (such as internal
   networks, DMZs, cloud segments, partner connections, and the public internet)
3. Map out traffic flows between your trust zones. Consider not just current
   usage, but future scalability and potential risks introduced by new services.

Documenting these trust boundaries helps clarify where the firewall fits into
the larger architecture. It also reveals unintended exposures, like legacy rules
that allow overly broad access between sensitive systems. This awareness forms
the basis for enforcing least privilege, minimizing attack surface, and
designing rules that reflect intentional, necessary access.

Your firewall policy is only as good as your understanding of the environment it
protects. Make network visibility your first priority.
